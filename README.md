# Project
This a client-server system application implementing a basic dropbox where a client may request a user for following four operations
1. Uploading a file
2. Download a file
3. View an existing file
4. Deleting a file if exist

The client side user can save a local file on the server side and can perform any of the other three operations. He can store the file 
along with the user name. To perform other operations he should enter the user name and file name to get access on the server side.

On the server side the files are stored in a binary file in the form of structures with its details. To get access to certain file 
the user should enter the particular username.
